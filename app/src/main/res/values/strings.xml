    <string name="policy_content">We value the trust you place in us. That\'s why we insist upon the highest standards for secure transactions and customer information privacy. Please read the following statement to learn about our information gathering and dissemination practices.</string>
    <string name="policy_content1">Our privacy policy is subject to change at any time without notice. To make sure you are aware of any changes, please review this policy periodically. By visiting this App you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our App. By mere use of the App, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use.</string>
    <string name="policy_content2">1. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and other Information When you use our App, we collect and store your personal information which is provided by you from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience.
        This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our App to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect personal information from you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.\n\n

       In general, you can browse the App without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not
        provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the App. We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our App. We use this information to do internal research on our users\' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our users.
        This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our App or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our App or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.  We use data collection devices such as \"cookies\" on certain pages of the App to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.
        \"Cookies\" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a \"cookie\". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.\n\n

        Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are \"session cookies,\" meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
        You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the App and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.
        Additionally, you may encounter \"cookies\" or other similar devices on certain pages of the App that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. If you choose to buy on the App, we collect information about your buying behaviour.\n\n

        If you transact with us, we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit / debit card number and a credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other payment instrument details and tracking information from cheques or money orders.\n\n

        If you choose to post messages on our message boards, chat rooms or other message areas or leave feedback, we will collect that information you provide to us.
        We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters,
        or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the App, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.\n\n

        We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card / debit card / other payment instrument details, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with us.
        While you can browse some sections of our App without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do require registration. We do use your contact  information to send you offers based on your previous orders and your interests.\n\n
        \n\n
        2. Use of Demographic / Profile Data / Your Information
We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the
extent we use your personal information to market to you, we will provide you
the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal information to
resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote a safe service; collect
money; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you
about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize
your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal
activity; enforce our terms and conditions; and as otherwise described to you
at the time of collection.
In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we
collect and analyse demographic and profile data about our user\'s activity on
our App. \n\n
        We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our
server, and to administer our App. Your IP address is also used to help
identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These
surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information
(like zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to tailor your
experience at our App, providing you with content that we think you might be
interested in and to display content according to your preferences.
Cookies \n\n
        A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a web server on a web
browser so it can be later read back from that browser. Cookies are useful for
enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given user. We
place both permanent and temporary cookies in your computer\'s hard drive.
The cookies do not contain any of your personally identifiable information. \n\n\n
        3. Sharing of personal information
We may share personal information with our other corporate entities and
affiliates. These entities and affiliates may market to you as a result of such
sharing unless you explicitly opt-out. \n\n

        We may disclose personal information to third parties. This disclosure may be
required for us to provide you access to our Services, to comply with our legal
obligations, to enforce our User Agreement, to facilitate our marketing and
advertising activities, or to prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate
fraudulent or illegal activities related to our Services. We do not disclose your
personal information to third parties for their marketing and advertising
purposes without your explicit consent. \n\n

        We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the
good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to
subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. We may disclose personal
information to law enforcement offices, third party rights owners, or others in
the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce
our Terms or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting
or other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights,
property or personal safety of our users or the general public.
We and our affiliates will share / sell some or all of your personal information
with another business entity should we (or our assets) plan to merge with, or
be acquired by that business entity, or re-organization, amalgamation,
restructuring of business. Should such a transaction occur that other business
entity (or the new combined entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy
with respect to your personal information. \n\n\n
